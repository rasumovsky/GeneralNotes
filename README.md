# GeneralNotes
This repository contains general notes on statistics, computer science, mathematics, and data science. As a fifth year graduate student, I have come to the realization that significant portions of my skillset and knowledge base are highly specialized. I intend to pursue a career outside of my field of study (experimental high-energy particle physics). In order to enhance my future job prospects, I decided that it would be useful to review basic concepts.
